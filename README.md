# .NET-Obfuscator

>.NET Obfuscator is a tool that is used to protect .NET applications from reverse engineering. 

* This is done by **transforming the original .NET code into a form that is difficult to understand**, making it hard for attackers to decompile the code and understand how it works. 

* This can help to **prevent the theft of intellectual property** and also protect against potential security vulnerabilities. 

* **Obfuscation** can also help to reduce the size of the code, which can improve the performance of the application.
